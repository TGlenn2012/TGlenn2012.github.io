    text: "Augmented Reality (AR) is a popular tool for youth to engage with technology in exciting ways; coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), these domains create unique opportunities for youth to explore, learn, and play. However, many systems today enable such experiences without allowing end-users to customize the contents’ looks or behavior. To this end, we developed MicrokARts, allowing children to (1) create an IoT kart, clad with actuators and sensors, (2) program using our block-based programming environment, and (3) interact wirelessly in a dynamic AR-IoT environment. We tested our initial system with 4 Graduate Student Experts and 15 Youth (age=11--18), before testing MicrokARts with 22 users (ages=9--15). We observed how children designed their interactions using AR and IoT devices, and their engagement with the technology. Through this work, we contribute to continued efforts to support youth in building foundational understandings of physical computing to enhance creative play."
