As someone who has a distinct passion for empowering our Youth, I was chosen to lead both our Toy Design course for middle school students, and our Smart Toys & Robots course for high school students in conjunction with the Gifted Education Reserach & Resource Institute (GER<sup>2</sup>I) at Purdue University. During the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019, I not only lead this initiative, but designed the Smart Toys & Robots course, where those students were exposed to a myriad of STEM concepts (Fabrication, Programming, Electronics, and much more) and helping the students create an interconnected toy network using a mixture of everyday materials (cardboard, plastic bottles, aluminum cans, etc.), circuits, and much more. The 14 students’ final project involved working in a group of 3-4 to build a Battlebot whose primary function was to pop a balloon located on the rear end of their opponent’s robot, while being controlled completely through Wifi communication. 

My efforts in this endeavor were not only helpful in implementing this high school-level course but has set the foundation for the ME 496 course, titled: **Design and Prototyping of Smart Things**, that was taught during the 2018-2019 academic year with Sophomore-level students in the School of Mechanical Engineering. Since I designed and started teaching this course, it has become a very successful and popular course for the GER<sup>2</sup>I program. A student who recently applied to and was accepted to Purdue’s First-Year Engineering program stated to my advisor, Dr. Ramani, in an email that 
> “I have been coming back to GERI for four years now and it was by far the best class I have taken. I truly have learned a lot. It is an amazing experience, Terrell is an excellent instructor and so is Pashin my coach. Pashin and Terrell taught me about circuits, augmented reality, and the use of CAD software.” 

The course has been halted since the COVID-19 pandemic began, so I have not gotten the opportunity to continue working in this capacity since 2019. However, I look forward to seeing the tradition of this course continue during the summer of 2022 when the program is brought back to Purdue. I hope to return as a guest lecturer or in some small capacity after my graduation.
