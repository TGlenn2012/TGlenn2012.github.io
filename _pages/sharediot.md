    text: "Augmented Reality (AR) presents opportunities for shared experiences between users, leading to more engagement among them. Internet of Things (IoT) devices can communicate with one another, delivering/receiving instructions for executing their various functions. Such shared experiences create opportunities for interaction, ideation, and creativity. However, it is still difficult for novice makers to create unique experiences with dynamic, interactive, and engaging AR content that communicate effectively with other devices on a network. We present our solution to designing Shared Experiences with AR and IoT (ShARed IoT) devices. Our system enables users to interact with each other and their electro-mechanical prototypes through AR. A Projective Interview study with 8 UX experts and a field study with 13 users were conducted. Our results show ShARed IoT as a system enables unique shared AR-IoT experiences for both novices and expert users. This work contributes to efforts in enabling complex AR-IoT interactions for novices."

IoT devices are crafted from low-fidelity materials and electronics from our Electronics Repository, and then programmed with our block-based programming tool called IoT Maker. Cloud Anchors enable the sharing and control of AR content across multiple smartphones, and our wireless communication protocol enables control of a users customized ShARed IoT device across those smartphones." %}
