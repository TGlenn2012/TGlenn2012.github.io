    text: "Makerspaces can support educational experiences in prototyping for children. Storytelling platforms enable high levels of creativity and expression, but have high barriers of entry. We introduce StoryMakAR, which combines making and storytelling. StoryMakAR is a new AR-IoT system for children that uses block programming, physical prototyping, and event-based storytelling to bring stories to life. We reduce the barriers to entry for youth (Age=14-18) by designing an accessible, plug-and-play system through merging both electro-mechanical devices and virtual characters to create stories. We describe our initial design process, the evolution and workflow of StoryMakAR, and results from multiple single-session workshops with 33 high school students. Our preliminary studies led us to understand what students want to make. We provide evidence of how students both engage and have difficulties with maker-based storytelling. We also discuss the potential for StoryMakAR to be used as a learning environment for classrooms and younger students."

(a) Users build electro-mechanical devices, program them using our drag-and-drop environment, DeviceMakAR, and control them with our plug-and-play MakAR Board. (b) Users create events for their story with EventMakAR. (c) Finally, using an AR-enabled cell phone, users control the physical devices by using the virtual characters to create Virtual-Physical Interactions." %}
