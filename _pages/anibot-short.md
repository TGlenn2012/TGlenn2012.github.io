title: "Ani-Bot: A Mixed-Reality Ready Modular Robotics System"
excerpt: "Ani-Bot is a Mixed Reality Toolkit that offers modular electronics that can be assembled via magnetic connections on the top and bottom of each module. A Microsoft Hololens is used to superimpose AR holograms on top of the modules and control the modules via hand gestures."

    text: "We present Ani-Bot, a modular robotics system that allows users to construct Do-It-Yourself (DIY) robots and use mixed-reality approach to interact with them. Ani-Bot enables novel user experience by embedding Mixed-Reality Interaction (MRI) in the three phases of interacting with a modular construction kit, namely, Creation, Tweaking, and Usage.
In this paper, we first present the system design that allows users to instantly perform MRI once they finish assembling the robot. Further, we discuss the augmentations offered by
MRI in the three phases in specific."
