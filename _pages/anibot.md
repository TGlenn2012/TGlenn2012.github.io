title: "Ani-Bot: A Modular Robotics System Supporting Creation, Tweaking, and Usage with Mixed-Reality Interactions"
excerpt: "Ani-Bot is a Mixed Reality Toolkit that offers modular electronics that can be assembled via magnetic connections on the top and bottom of each module. A Microsoft Hololens is used to superimpose AR holograms on top of the modules and control the modules via hand gestures."

    text: "Ani-Bot is a modular robotics system that allows users to control their DIY robots using Mixed-Reality Interaction (MRI). This system takes advantage of MRI to enable users to visually program the robot through the augmented view of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). In this paper, we first explain the design of the Mixed-Reality (MR) ready modular robotics
system, which allows users to instantly perform MRI once they finish assembling the robot. Then, we elaborate the augmentations provided by the MR system in the three primary
phases of a construction kit’s lifecycle: Creation, Tweaking, and Usage. Finally, we demonstrate Ani-Bot with four application examples and evaluate the system with a two-session
user study. The results of our evaluation indicate that Ani-Bot does successfully embed MRI into the lifecycle (Creation, Tweaking, Usage) of DIY robotics and that it does show strong
potential for delivering an enhanced user experience."

(4) The system can assist users in the assembly process, and (5) help them tweak ineffective designs through virtual tryout. (6) Taking advantage of mixed-reality, users can easily program their robots to perform environmentally interactive tasks, such as adding sugar to a teacup or shooting objects into a bowl." %}
