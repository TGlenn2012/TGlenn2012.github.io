For this final project, I designed a lesson plan for the students at Tecumseh Jr. High School to learn a topic related to their 8th grade science curriculum. Within the 8th grade science class, there are 150 students total. ~40 of those students are “accelerated learning” students and are capable of more than the other classes. I will be working with and 8th grade science tech at Tecumseh, who has worked there for over 15 years. Within the 8th grade science class, there are 135 students total. This Chemistry teacher has all her students broken up into groups of four students with 5 - 7 groups per class depending on class size.

In the science class, the students used an experimental Augmented Reality (AR) software called StoryMakAR, which combines physical prototyping, AR, and the Internet of Things to bring stories to life. StoryMakAR is accompanied by two additional applications for the computer and cell phone called DeviceMakAR and EventMakAR, which enable the students to program various electro-mechanical devices with little-to-no programming experience and import those devices into a story that they have written (see [StoryMakAR](#)). Although the original intent of this project was to have the students use StoryMakAR, DeviceMakAR, and EventMakAR, we were unable to do so due to time constraints. Therefore, we adjusted the scope of the project to only have them use StoryMakAR and the MakAR Board for this in-class lab assignment.
