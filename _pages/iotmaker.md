title: "IoT Maker: Creating High-Level Electro-Mechanical Devices Through Live Programming for Youth"
excerpt: "IoT Maker is an IoT creation platform that utilizes live programming, an integrated block-based programming language, and a lightweight companion app for mobile/desktop that pairs wirelessly with a customized circuit board that we call the iBoard."

    text: "Microcontrollers are a popular tool to use when designing electro-mechanical devices with low-level functionality, and those with more complex, high-level functionality. Block-based programming interfaces are ideal environments to program physical computing devices, lowering the barrier of entry for novice programmers. The advent of live programming yields a more engaging and thorough process of programming such devices but leaves much to be desired due to primitive functionalities or high barriers of entry. To understand the impact of live programming on designing complex electro-mechanical devices, we developed a plug-and-play electronics module and an accompanying block-based live programming environment. We conducted an evaluation study with 4 expert users to elicit critical feedback and validity, followed by a user study with 15 youths (age=11-18). The results show that our system helps reduce the barrier to entry for youths to create electro-mechanical devices with advanced functionalities and a novice understanding of the field at baseline."

Users (a) drag-and-drop blocks of code into the programming environment and (b) watch their code execute in real-time on the screen, while interacting with sensors via sliders, buttons, and color pickers. Once the user has a sufficient understanding of the functionality of their code, they can (c) upload the code to our customized iBoard, and (d) connect their phone, tablet, or computer to the iBoard, and control the electronics via WiFi." %}
