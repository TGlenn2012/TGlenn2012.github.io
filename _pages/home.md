### Bachelor of Science in Physics at Morehouse College
* Location: Atlanta, Georgia
* Minor: Mathematics
* GPA: 3.66/4.0
* Graduation: May 2016

As an undergraduate, I founded the robotics team at Morehouse College, the RoboTigers and started a series of STEM workshops for inner-city students as the President and Founder of the team. We taught the students basic concepts in Engineering, programming, and CAD software using a fun and interactive game of my design. These workshops sparked my interest in inspiring the youth to pursue careers in STEM, a passion that I has brought with me to Indiana. I also served as a Resident Advisor (RA) during 2.5 of my 4 years at the College, ending my Senior year as the lead RA for the historic Samuel T. Graves House.

### Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University
* Location: West Lafayette, Indiana
* Focus: Human-Computer Interaction & Engineering Education
* GPA: 3.62/4.0
* Expected Graduation: December 2021

As I've been completing my Ph.D, I've undertaken numerous personal and professional endeavors. In addition to coursework, I lead the *Smart Toys & Robots* Summer Workshop for middle and high school students, started the Indianapolis Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) Fair, serve as a mentor in the Alpha Esquires of Indianapolis Mentorship program, as well as a two-year mentor for the Head's Up Mentoring Program in Lafayette, Indiana. My thesis is titled **Empowering Youth to Design, Build, and Play through Interactions with Augmented Reality, Physical Prototyping, and the Internet of Things**. I look forward to finishing up my research and defending soon!
